# Checks

`sql-lint` comes with its own suite of checks. Aside from its own checks, it
also returns any errors from the SQL server you have connected to. Generally
you'll find that the errors from `sql-lint` are more informative than those from
the server. That said, you will still want errors from the server as it covers
more cases and will catch things that `sql-lint` does not.

*<small>This check came about whilst working Microsoft Excel. Microsoft likes to
add a lot of zany characters which can subtly break your data without you
realising.</small>
